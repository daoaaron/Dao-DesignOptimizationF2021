    "## Problem Formulation.\n",
    "In this project, we consider the task of landing a rocket, whose state $x(t)$ is defined as $$x(t) = [d(t), v(t)]^T,$$ where $d(t)$ and $v(t)$ are the rocket's distance to the ground and velocity in the downward direction, respectively. The rocket is controlled by the input $a(t)$ such that its dynamics follow \n",

    "where $f_{\\theta}(\\cdot)$ is a neural network with optimized parameters $\\theta$, $D$ a drag constant, and $g$ is the gravitational constant. Hence this simulation takes the assumption that the rocket is not only being acted upon by its own thrust, but also by drag and gravitational forces. \n",

    "*From the provided problem statement:*<br>\n",
    "For each time step, we assign a loss as a function of the control input and the state: $l(x(t),a(t))$. In this example, we will simply set $l(x(t),a(t))=0$ for all $t=1,...,T-1$, where $T$ is the final time step, and $$l(x(T),a(T)) = ||x(T)||^2 = d(T)^2 + v(T)^2.$$ This loss encourages the rocket to reach $d(T)=0$ and $v(T)=0$, which are proper landing conditions.\n",
