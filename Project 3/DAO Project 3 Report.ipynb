    "In this project, we use Dr. Sigmund's original \"top99\" code to explore the evolution of mass density in a support beam as a downward load is placed in varying locations on its top edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass density $x$ is calculated by optimizing the structure's stiffness by solving the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{\\bf x} \\quad {\\bf f} := {\\bf d}^T {\\bf K}({\\bf x}) {\\bf d} $$\n",

    "We modify the MATLAB function top88.m, which is a modified version of top99.m created by the class professor, to take as an input the location at which the load is applied. This location is constrained to sweep across the nodes in the top edge of the structure. Implementing this allows us to visualize the optimal distribution of mass in the structure as the load moves across the top edge.   \n",
